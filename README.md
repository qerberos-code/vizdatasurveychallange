We went through 2 ~ 3 sessions of the survey quesiton ( see the link below)

Section 1:
— why are they not answering certain questions in the survey?
Demographics: male, female, LGBTQ

Section 2 
How would they know:
Based on where you live, how does your level of pay compare to other people doing this type of work?

If the previous year surveys were the same as last year ’23, we could show the trend of moving from  remote to hybrid.  
Comparison with other industries and explain.

Section 3:

Position and primary focus, secondary or etc…

We can do something pretty cool -   they divide section to freelancer, and employees

What is the difference between the tools and the scope.

Here ar esome good questionss in the '23 survey:
  For most of your freelance projects, are you able to choose your own tools or are the choices made for you?
  What type of problems do you encounter when clients choose the tools?

Action item:
Each of us are goign to take a look the previous year surveys and go through the 2023 survey.
