Comparison with other industries and explain.

Section 3A (freelancer):

Position and primary focus, secondary or etc…

#We can do something pretty cool -   they divide section to freelancer, and employees

What is the difference between the tools and the scope.

Here ar esome good questionss in the '23 survey:
  For most of your freelance projects, are you able to choose your own tools or are the choices made for you?
  What type of problems do you encounter when clients choose the tools?

Action item:
Each of us are goign to take a look the previous year surveys and go through the 2023 survey.

# I am very interested in this question: How often do you use each of the following technologies for data visualization?

I don't know any of those tools: Figma (it's wireframe/ mock UI), Flourish (a website with a lot of data (graph) templates), highcharts, leaflet (interactive with Javascript), looker, Observable, P5/Processing, Svelte (similar to react), Vega, Vue, WebGL  

(you suppose to use some of the tools (like the add-on) together.)  

Thoughts:  We could talk about the trend that evolved over time.

# I am very interested in this question: Name up to three tools you "most enjoy" using for data visualization.

Thoughts:  Most enjoyable is different from the tools being used. 

Section 5 (Challanges and Changes):

# I am very interested in this question: How much does each of the following challenges impact your data visualization practice?

#  I am very interested in this question: What current or recent barriers have you faced in getting into data visualization professionally?

#  I am very interested in this question: What do you think people you work with just don’t get about the data visualization work that you do?

Section 6:

We can consider section 5: the tool, and section 2 the salary 

#Action item:

#looking into data in section 5: the tool, and section 2 the salary from 2020 to 2023  Angus and Truc

Day 11: (break)


Day 10:

Truc showed us the number of distinct tools being used.

We came up an idea to develop a story of speed networking strategies to enter data visualization (based on the tool) 
We all have limited time at a data visulation social event.  With provided data, we have analyzed the data dn created a data visualization to for very simple approach to identify the right person to talk to at a meetup or social event.
The profile: The targeted person is an employee of a company with 7 - 10 years of experience. The person uses 7 visualization tools. Here are the tools: a, b c, and d. 
With this profile, you can easily identify the targeted person with in short amount of time at a data visualization meetup event.

graph one: number of distinct tools are being used.
