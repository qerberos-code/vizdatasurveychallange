Explaination

THE CHALLANGE TIMELINE
Launch: February 16, 2024
Close: March 31, 2024
Winners Announced: April 30, 2024

OUR TIMELINE (We started on March 17)

Day 14 

set up communication channel
set up Tableau

Day 13

We went through 2 ~ 3 sessions of the survey quesiton ( see the link below)

Section 1:
— why are they not answering certain questions in the survey?
Demographics: male, female, LGBTQ

Section 2 
How would they know:
Based on where you live, how does your level of pay compare to other people doing this type of work?

If the previous year surveys were the same as last year ’23, we could show the trend of moving from  remote to hybrid.  
Comparison with other industries and explain.

Section 3A (freelancer):

Position and primary focus, secondary or etc…

#We can do something pretty cool -   they divide section to freelancer, and employees

What is the difference between the tools and the scope.

Here ar esome good questionss in the '23 survey:
  For most of your freelance projects, are you able to choose your own tools or are the choices made for you?
  What type of problems do you encounter when clients choose the tools?

Action item:
Each of us are goign to take a look the previous year surveys and go through the 2023 survey.

Day 12:

Section 3B (Your work for your employer): 

Section 3C (Your work as an academic or teacher):

Section 3D (Your work as a student):

Section 3E (Your persona data visualization):

Section 4 (Charts and Tools):

Scrollytelling
--
I am very interested in this question: How often do you use each of the following technologies for data visualization?

I don't know any of those tools: Figma (it's wireframe/ mock UI), Flourish (a website with a lot of data (graph) templates), highcharts, leaflet (interactive with Javascript), looker, Observable, P5/Processing, Svelte (similar to react), Vega, Vue, WebGL  

(you suppose to use some of the tools (like the add-on) together.)  

Thoughts:  We could talk about the trend that evolved over time.

I am very interested in this question: Name up to three tools you "most enjoy" using for data visualization.

Thoughts:  Most enjoyable is different from the tools being used. 

Section 5 (Challanges and Changes):

I am very interested in this question: How much does each of the following challenges impact your data visualization practice?

I am very interested in this question: What current or recent barriers have you faced in getting into data visualization professionally?

I am very interested in this question: What do you think people you work with just don’t get about the data visualization work that you do?

Section 6:

We can consider section 5: the tool, and section 2 the salary 

Action item:

creating a mock up website ( the goal is to show the trends)  Sabari
looking into data in section 5: the tool, and section 2 the salary from 2020 to 2023  Angus and Truc

Day 11: (break)


Day 10:

Truc showed us the number of distinct tools being used.

We came up an idea to develop a story of speed networking strategies to enter data visualization (based on the tool; dataset 4). We all have limited time at a data visulation social event.  

With provided data, we have analyzed the data ( set 4) dn created a data visualization to for very simple approach to identify the right person to talk to at a meetup or social event.

Based on our experience, there are huge interest to enter data visualization field. Without knowing the right people and the tool to use, it can be challanged to penertate the field. Our goal is to quickly identify the right person(s) to engage at a data visualization social event (Dataviz is one of them of course) with limited time he/she has.

The Methodogly: 
Q1. How often do you use the tool?
Q2. The top 3 tools you most enjoy using.

We have identified the most of people use 7 tools.
The most data vizulation role is employee (of a company) among other roles such as academic, freelancer, hobbist or student.  Within this group, most of them have 7 - 10 years of experience. 

Here are the most used top 3 preferred tools: a, b and c. ( we are thinking using tree map.)

With this profile, you can easily identify the targeted person with in short amount of time to strike a conversation at a data visualization meetup/social event.

Day 9:

we fine tuned our story, started to finalize our graph choice and worked on the website.

Day 8: 
Truc cleaned the ToolsLiking_Top3 column.
Truc uploaded the following clean datasets:

Day 6:
Sabari showcased Flourish for data viz.
Angus granted website access. The team can start to embedded graphs on the website.
The team will go through different types of graph to see whether it's a good fit to tell the story.

Day 3:

story: Imagine you are interested in entering data visualization field, but don't know where to start. After months of research, you finally decide to take a leap of faith to go to a data visulization social event. You are overwhelmed stepping into a room full of potential connections at the event, each may potentially lead to an opportunity. Each has their unique expertise and preferences in tools. However,the challenge is you only have 15 minutes for networking to find the right person to talk to,espcially someone who can open doors for you to opportunities. How can you quickly idenifity the right person? 

That's where our innovative approach comes into play. We have made it very simple for you by analyzing the data which guide you to your ideal conversation partner at any data visualization meetup or social event.

Note under the figure: the data has been transformed and simply for the general audience.


With an extensive analysis of the dataset, the querberos team discovered that most professionals predominantly use seven key tools and generally hold certain roles within companies, boasting 7-10 years of experience.

We have identified the most of people use 7 tools.

From this, we've pinpointed the top three tools preferred by these professionals in the industries.

(Sabri has the image.)

By asking just three simple questions about tool usage and preferences we've designed, you can quickly identify who you should be talking to.

What do you like to use? 

What's your role? ( we need to show that employee is the target; sabri's graph)

What's your years of experience? (7 - 10 years of experience; Truc's graph)

What are the top 3 tools you most enjoy (?) using or often use at work?  (Show tableau; sankey)

(If you would like to drill down into the frequency, here is the detailed bubble chart: https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/17363730/)

By tailoring just these four simple questions about tool usage and preferences we've designed into your networkign conversation, you could quickly identify who you should be talking to at a social event.

With an extensive analysis of the datasets, the Querberos team discovered that most professionals predominantly use 7 key tools and generally hold certain roles within companies, boasting 6-10 years of experience. (we are replacing it with the published one; please highlight what we tried to emphasie on with different color)
