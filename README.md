We went through 2 ~ 3 sessions of the survey quesiton ( see the link below)

Section 1:
— why are they not answering certain questions in the survey?
Demographics: male, female, LGBTQ

Section 2 
How would they know:
Based on where you live, how does your level of pay compare to other people doing this type of work?

If the previous year surveys were the same as last year ’23, we could show the trend of moving from  remote to hybrid.  
Comparison with other industries and explain.

Section 3A (freelancer):

Position and primary focus, secondary or etc…

#We can do something pretty cool -   they divide section to freelancer, and employees

What is the difference between the tools and the scope.

Here ar esome good questionss in the '23 survey:
  For most of your freelance projects, are you able to choose your own tools or are the choices made for you?
  What type of problems do you encounter when clients choose the tools?

Action item:
Each of us are goign to take a look the previous year surveys and go through the 2023 survey.

--
# I am very interested in this question: How often do you use each of the following technologies for data visualization?

I don't know any of those tools: Figma (it's wireframe/ mock UI), Flourish (a website with a lot of data (graph) templates), highcharts, leaflet (interactive with Javascript), looker, Observable, P5/Processing, Svelte (similar to react), Vega, Vue, WebGL  

(you suppose to use some of the tools (like the add-on) together.)  

Thoughts:  We could talk about the trend that evolved over time.

# I am very interested in this question: Name up to three tools you "most enjoy" using for data visualization.

Thoughts:  Most enjoyable is different from the tools being used. 

Section 5 (Challanges and Changes):

# I am very interested in this question: How much does each of the following challenges impact your data visualization practice?

#  I am very interested in this question: What current or recent barriers have you faced in getting into data visualization professionally?

#  I am very interested in this question: What do you think people you work with just don’t get about the data visualization work that you do?

Section 6:

We can consider section 5: the tool, and section 2 the salary 

#Action item:

#creating a mock up website ( the goal is to show the trends)  Sabari
#looking into data in section 5: the tool, and section 2 the salary from 2020 to 2023  Angus and Truc

Day 11: (break)


Day 10:

Truc showed us the number of distinct tools being used.

We came up an idea to develop a story of speed networking strategies to enter data visualization (based on the tool; dataset 4). We all have limited time at a data visulation social event.  

With provided data, we have analyzed the data ( set 4) dn created a data visualization to for very simple approach to identify the right person to talk to at a meetup or social event.

Based on our experience, there are huge interest to enter data visualization field. Without knowing the right people and the tool to use, it can be challanged to penertate the field. Our goal is to quickly identify the right person(s) to engage at a data visualization social event (Dataviz is one of them of course) with limited time he/she has.

The Methodogly: 
Q1. How often do you use the tool?
Q2. The top 3 tools you most enjoy using.

We have identified the most of people use 7 tools.
The most data vizulation role is employee (of a company) among other roles such as academic, freelancer, hobbist or student.  Within this group, most of them have 7 - 10 years of experience. 

Here are the most used top 3 preferred tools: a, b and c. ( we are thinking using tree map.)

With this profile, you can easily identify the targeted person with in short amount of time to strike a conversation at a data visualization meetup/social event.
